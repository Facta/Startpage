FAQ
===

In the past there’s been some confusion about the purpose of this site. Some
took it as my suggestions for a better Google design, which couldn’t be further
from the truth. Go is nothing more than a personal start site for myself and 
everybody else who finds it to make their life easier.

In other words, it is deliberately too minimalistic, with most features hidden
behind plain sight, just in order to get out of your way and be efficient to use
once you know how to. Now onto the actual FAQ …


1) Using the Go Source Code
---------------------------

Q: How do I install it?
A: Simply extract it anywhere and open index.htm. There’s no need to set up 
   a full web server since all the code is executed in the browser.

Q: Can I put it on my own web server? Change the styling? Share it?
A: You're free to tweak, modify and share Go as long as you don’t pass it off 
   as your own work and keep the copyright notice in the HTML file.

Q: Auto-complete doesn’t work!
A: This is an unfortunaty security problem with some browsers that don’t allow 
   XMLHttpRequests to external servers.


2) The Google Stylesheet
------------------------

Q: What does it do?
A: It mainly adds some nice styling to the input field and submit button on 
   the search results page but includes some small misc tweaks as well.

Q: How do I install this?
A: Set is as your user stylesheet in Safari’s advanced preferences. Firefox
   has an extension called “Stylish” that provides support for user stylesheets. 
   However...
	
Q: The stylesheet doesn’t look right in Firefox!
A: Yes, I’m aware of that. I’ll fix it as soon as I get a chance.
